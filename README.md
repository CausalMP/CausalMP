# **Repository for CausalMP**  

This repository contains the **data and code** used in our paper:  

**[Can We Validate Counterfactual Estimations in the Presence of General Network Interference?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01106)**  
*Authors: Sadegh Shirani, Yuwei Luo, William Overman, Ruoxuan Xiong, Mohsen Bayati*  

## **Overview**  

This repository will include:  
- Data from all six environments used in the paper.  
- Code for reproducing experiments and analyses.  
- Documentation and instructions for usage.  

We are releasing the data and code in multiple stages.  

### **Current Release**  
ðŸ“Œ **02/04/2025**: We are currently releasing the **LLM-based Social Agents experiment data**.  

### **Upcoming Releases**  
ðŸ”œ In the next stages, we will gradually add:  
- Data from the remaining environments.  
- Code implementations for our models and experiments.  
- Scripts for reproducing key results from the paper.  

Stay tuned for updates!
